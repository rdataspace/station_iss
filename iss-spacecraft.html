					<p>The International Space Station is a spacecraft flying in a circular Earth orbit at an altitude between 278 and 460 km. It will remain in orbit as long as it is practical to be maintained and updated. Like a satellite, it is not designed to return to Earth or to leave orbit.</p>
					<p>All materials and personnel used to build, operate and maintain the station are transported from the Earth by dedicated spacecraft missions. Each mission is carefully planned to optimise pay load capacity and ensure materials are delivered as required.</p> 
					<p>Most station spacecraft use rocket launch vehicles (launchers) to reach orbit and then use their own engines to rendezvous with the ISS. The U.S. Space Shuttle, however, uses its own engines, with the help of booster rockets, to reach orbit.</p>   
					<p>Many different spacecraft have been used to build, operate and maintain the ISS</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Right col -->

				<div class="rightCol">				
						<p>Up until 2008 only Russian and U.S. craft were used with some international pay loads carried on the U.S. Space Shuttle. In March 2008 the first international craft was launched by the European Space Agency and flown, un-piloted, to the station. This was followed in September 2009 by the first Japanese craft, also un-piloted.</p>
						<p>In May 2012 the first commercial craft was flown to the station. This was an un-piloted cargo craft and launcher by the U.S. company SpaceX. Later in September 2013 another U.S. commercial company, Orbital ATK, also launched a cargo only craft to the station.</p>
						<p>Updated versions of the Russian, European, Japanese and U.S. commercial craft continue to fly to the station. The U.S. Space Shuttles, however were discontinued with the last flight to the station in July 2011.</p>

			<!-- Spacecraft Mission Steps -->

			<div class="barH2"><h2>Spacecraft Mission Steps</h2>
			</div>

			<!-- Left col -->

			<div class="grid-2col">
				<div class="leftCol">				
					<p>The mission of a spacecraft to the station has five main steps:-</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>1. Launching</h3>
					</div>
					<p>The first step is to launch the spacecraft and overcome the Earth's gravity so that it can be placed in a similar orbit to the station.</p>
					<p>The launching method varies depending on the size and type of craft being launched. All launch vehicles, however, use either liquid or solid fuelled rocket engines.</p>
					<p>The launch vehicles are also generally multi-staged. The first stage usually use a number of large engines to initially lift the weight of the spacecraft, launch vehicle and fuel. When the first stage fuel is used the stage and fuel tanks are discarded to be destroyed or returned to Earth for re-use. The craft is then lighter and subsequent stages use smaller engines. These stages are similarly discarded until only the spacecraft remains in orbit.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>2. Rendezvous</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Once the spacecraft is in orbit it needs to catch up and match velocity and orbit with the station.</p>
					<p>The launch vehicle can only place the spacecraft in particular orbits relative to the launching place on Earth. Spacecraft then use their own rocket engines to catch up to the station and match its orbital altitude and speed. The craft is then motionless, relative to the station, and can be docked.</p>
				</div>
				
				<!-- Right col -->

				<div class="rightCol">				
					<div class="barH3"><h3>3. Docking</h3>
					</div>
					<p class="padt">Two methods are used to attach the spacecraft securely to the station with an air-tight seal.</p>
					<p><span class="color">Powered Docking</span> - Using remote control from the station or Earth, small rocket engines (thrusters) on the craft are used to guide it to the docking point. After initial contact the docking mechanism pulls the craft in and securely locks it to the station with an air tight seal.</p>
					<p><span class="color">Capture Docking</span> - The station's robot arm is used to grapple a fixture on the craft and move it into the initial docking contact position. This method is only used for the smaller un-piloted craft.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>4. Un-docking</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Un-docking is the reverse procedure to docking and uses a similar method. After un-docked the spacecraft uses its thruster to move to a safe distance clear of the station and then uses its main engines to slow down for de-orbit.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>5. De-orbiting</h3>
					</div>
					<p>When the spacecraft has slowed sufficiently gravity pulls the craft into the Earth's atmosphere. If the craft is designed to return to Earth it will either land or use parachutes for its final descent. Some un-piloted craft are not intended to return to Earth and are destroyed by the friction of entering the atmosphere.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<!-- Spacecraft Mission Categories -->

			<div class="barH2"><h2>Spacecraft Mission Categories</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="grid-2col">

				<!-- Left col -->

				<div class="leftCol">				

					<p>Spacecraft missions to the station can be grouped into the following three categories:-</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>1. Main Component Delivery</h3>
					</div>
					<p>U.S. Space Shuttles have been used on the majority of the missions to transport and install the main components and associated equipment on the station. Four Russian un-piloted craft were also used on dedicated missions for Russian Segment components. New components are now delivered by U.S. commercial craft as the U.S. Space Shuttles are no longer in service.</p>

					<div class="barH3"><h3>2. Station Crew Transport</h3>
					</div>
					<p>To date, only two types of spacecraft are capable of flying crew to the station and back to Earth. The first station crew, Expedition One, was flown to the station in a Russian Soyuz TM craft using a Russian Soyuz U booster rocket. The Soyuz TM craft remained docked to the station for use as an emergency escape vehicle for the station crew. It was regularly replaced with a "fresh" craft of the same type.</p>
					<p>The next five station crew rotations used U.S. Space Shuttles which also carried their own crews. The Shuttle crews assisted the station crews with building and maintenance operations. The Shuttle was then grounded for a period and the Russian Soyuz craft was again used for station crew transport. This type of craft, with a number of upgrades has been used since for all station crew rotations. Shuttles have also been used to transport additional station crew.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Right col -->

				<div class="rightCol">				
					<div class="barH3"><h3>3. Supplies and Materials</h3>
					</div>
					<p class="padt">Supplies include all those goods needed to operate, maintain, live in and use the station. The ISS is a habitable spacecraft and needs to be maintained in orbit and provide life support for its crew and visitors. It therefore requires regular deliveries of consumables such as fuel, water, food, oxygen and spare parts. It is also a working research station requiring specific equipment and the transport of experiment materials from and to the Earth.</p>
					<p>The U.S. Space Shuttle was the main vehicle for delivering supplies to the station because of its large cargo capacity. Following the shuttle's last flight to the station, in July 2011, only the smaller Russian Progress, European ATV and Japanese HTV craft were available for station supply missions. None of these vehicles are designed to return to Earth. After the completion of their missions they are deliberately destroyed.</p>
					<p>NASA therefore looked to the U.S. private sector to build commercial "re-supply" spacecraft and launchers to increase the capacity to supply the station. To date two companies, SpaceX and Orbital ATK have provided craft which have successfully flown supplies the station. SpaceX has also successfully returned a capsule to Earth. NASA is now looking for a commercial vehicle to carry crew to and from the station while it is developing new vehicles.</p>
					<p>Although all missions carried some supplies, the table below summarizes dedicated supply missions only and excludes the component and crew missions covered in the sections above.</p>
